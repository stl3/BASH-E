  <h2 align="center">BASH-E</h2>
</p>

A command line DALL-E Playground, based largely on the wonderful work of Sahar Mor's [DALL-E Playground](https://github.com/saharmor/dalle-playground).  Uses the open-source version of
OpenAI's [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), based on [DALL-E Mini](https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini).

## Usage

1.  Clone this repo locally
2.  cd $repo/backend
3.  pip install -r requirements.txt
4.  [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
5.  python BASH-E.py

BASH-E takes the following arguments:

--num (number of images to generate)

--prompt (text prompt)

--format (format to use)

--save_dir (custom directory to save in)

Currently this is just a quick and dirty setup, and I plan on expanding more as time goes on.

## Acknowledgements

This Repo is laregly a fork of [Sahar Mor's](https;//github.com/saharmor) Dall-E Playground repository.  I'm not a skilled coder, and a lot of the Python that I've learned in here is either a modification from it, directly from there, or at least, used as a framework for later code.

The repo this was based on is a full-stack flavour of [Boris Dayma's](https://github.com/borisdayma) DALL-E Mini
repository.
